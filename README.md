## Revenue-Data-Analysis(Interactive Dashboard Creation Using Power BI)

# Project objective

The process and key insights for analyzing revenue data within this project. Our analysis leverages the provided dimension and fact tables to understand booking patterns, identify revenue drivers, and track performance over time.

The following tables are used for revenue analysis:

- dim_date: Contains date-related dimensions (e.g., day, month, year, quarter) essential for time-series analysis.

- dim_hotels: Provides details about each hotel, including hotel ID, property name, city, and potentially other attributes like star rating or hotel chain.

- dim_rooms: Contains information about different room types, including room ID, room class, and potentially standard price.

- fact_bookings: The primary transaction table for individual bookings, containing booking ID, hotel ID, room ID, check-in/check-out dates, number of guests, booking price, and other relevant booking-level details.

- fact_aggregated_bookings: This table likely contains pre-aggregated booking data, potentially by date, hotel, or room type, which can significantly speed up certain analyses. (Assumptions about its structure are made below; adjust as per actual content).

# Key Revenue Metrics

Our analysis focuses on, but is not limited to, the following key revenue metrics:

- Total Revenue: The sum of all booking prices.

- Average Daily Rate (ADR): Total room revenue divided by the number of rooms sold.

- Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR): Total room revenue divided by the total number of available rooms in the hotel. (Requires dim_hotels and potentially occupancy data, or calculation from fact_bookings).

- Average Booking Value: Total revenue divided by the number of bookings.

- Revenue Growth: Percentage change in revenue over different periods (e.g., month-over-month, year-over-year).

- Revenue by Hotel: Breakdown of revenue generated by each individual hotel.

- Revenue by Room Type: Breakdown of revenue generated by different room classes.

- Revenue by City: Aggregated revenue based on the hotel's city.

- Cancellation Rate Impact on Revenue: Analyzing revenue loss due to cancelled bookings (if cancellation status is available in fact_bookings).

# Analytical Approaches and Insights

# 1. Overall Revenue Performance

Objective: Understand the total revenue generated over a specific period.

Query Focus: Summing booking_price from fact_bookings.

Potential Insights:

Overall financial health of the business.

Identifying peak and off-peak seasons.

# 2. Time-Series Revenue Analysis

Objective: Analyze revenue trends over time (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).

Query Focus: Joining fact_bookings (or fact_aggregated_bookings) with dim_date to group revenue by various date dimensions.

Potential Insights:

Seasonality patterns in bookings and revenue.

Impact of marketing campaigns or external events.

Identifying periods of high growth or decline.

# 3. Revenue by Hotel & Location Analysis

Objective: Determine which hotels and cities are the highest revenue generators.

Query Focus: Joining fact_bookings (or fact_aggregated_bookings) with dim_hotels to group revenue by hotel_id, property_name, and city.

Potential Insights:

Identifying top-performing properties.

Understanding geographical revenue distribution.

Highlighting areas for focused marketing or operational improvements.

# 4. Revenue by Room Type Analysis
Objective: Understand the revenue contribution of different room categories.

Query Focus: Joining fact_bookings with dim_rooms to group revenue by room_class.

Potential Insights:

Identifying the most profitable room types.

Informing pricing strategies for different room classes.

Optimizing room inventory.

# 5. Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue Per Available Room (RevPAR) Analysis

Objective: Evaluate pricing efficiency and revenue generation per available room.

Query Focus: These metrics require calculations based on fact_bookings and potentially dim_hotels (for total available rooms).

- ADR: SUM(booking_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT booking_id) (for rooms sold) or SUM(booking_price) / SUM(num_rooms_booked) if num_rooms_booked is available.

- RevPAR: SUM(booking_price) / Total_Available_Rooms (requires total_rooms from dim_hotels or similar).

Potential Insights:

Effectiveness of pricing strategies.

Hotel performance in maximizing revenue from available inventory.

# 6. Booking Channel/Source Analysis (if data available)

Objective: If your fact_bookings table includes a booking_channel or source field, you can analyze revenue generated from different booking channels (e.g., direct, OTA, corporate).

Query Focus: Grouping revenue by booking_channel.

Potential Insights:

Identifying the most profitable booking channels.

Optimizing distribution strategies.

# 7. Discount Impact Analysis (if data available)

Objective: If discounts are applied and recorded in fact_bookings, analyze the impact of discounts on overall revenue and profitability.

Query Focus: Comparing revenue from discounted bookings vs. full-price bookings.

Potential Insights:

Effectiveness of promotional offers.

Optimizing discount strategies to maximize net revenue.
